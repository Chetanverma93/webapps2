# Exercise 1: Learning Git, Atom, and Markdown.

This is a `README` file. It's written in a markup language called, paradoxically, Markdown. Markdown is a quick way of writing basic HTML for excellent documentation and note-taking. Seriously, once you start using Markdown, you'll want to use it for everything.

But for now, you'll use it to complete this exercise.

## Primary Objective
Edit the `expectations.md` file in this repo. Using Markdown, create a list of reasonable course expectations for Web Apps II. These expectations should be what you expect of yourself, and what you expect of the course itself.
