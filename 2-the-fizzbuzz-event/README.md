# The FizzBuzz Event

Taking your simple `fizzBuzz()` function and mixing it with new knowledge of CSS, Event Listeners, and `document.createElement()`, we're going to make a good-looking, interactive FizzBuzz application!

## Primary Objective

Create a FizzBuzz app that allows users to input (however you choose) a number to fizzbuzz up to, then display the results.

The _one_ way you may not get input from users is `prompt()`. Input has to come from the DOM.

## Secondary Objectives
Use CSS classes to make the results look great!

## About This Repo
Use the existing `index.html` and `app.js` to write your code!
